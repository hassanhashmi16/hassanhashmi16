## 🧠 About Me

I’m a CS undergraduate with a strong interest in building real-world web applications.
I care about clean logic, solid fundamentals, and understanding systems instead of blindly following tutorials.

I started with web development to ship projects and gain practical experience, and I’m gradually moving toward more advanced backend systems and AI-driven technologies.

I believe consistency beats talent, and building beats overthinking.
