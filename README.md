## Hassan here 👋

I build things on the internet.

Computer Science undergraduate.
Web developer by skill, problem-solver by habit.

I like clean logic, strong fundamentals, and projects that push me a little past comfort. I use web development to ship real ideas today while moving toward bigger systems and AI tomorrow.

### Stack I use

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Node.js, FastAPI
* Firebase, Supabase
* Git & GitHub

### This GitHub is for

* Building instead of just watching tutorials
* Learning by breaking and fixing things
* Turning “what if?” into working code

### Currently

* Going deeper into backend & systems
* Building projects that actually matter

---

Learning. Building. Repeating.
